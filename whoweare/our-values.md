The Deutsch Foundation has been selective in the programs and institutions it has supported during its first 20 years of operation. Its directors and staff will continue this practice, carefully researching issues significant to the public welfare, monitoring innovative trends, and selecting areas for grant making where the foundation can have significant impact, given its limited resources. We intend to concentrate our funding in Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic region.
