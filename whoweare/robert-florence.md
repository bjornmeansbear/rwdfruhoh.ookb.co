### Career

The Robert W. Deutsch Foundation exists through the generosity of Robert Deutsch and Florence Kadish Deutsch, who believed in giving back to the community, supporting education and helping others throughout their lives.

As a graduate student in nuclear physics at UC Berkeley in the early 1950s and as an expert in the nuclear industry in the 1950s and 60s, Dr. Deutsch realized that the future of American industry would be shaped by increasingly complex technologies and systems. Helping major corporations use and manage rapidly changing technologies would become a central focus for his career.

In 1968, Dr. Deutsch launched his career as an entrepreneur with the founding of General Physics Corporation, which would become the leading provider of education and training programs for operating personnel in the nation’s nuclear power plants. His innovative training methods quickly proved to the industry that they could meet the stringent federal standards for operating safety by investing in the training of their plant personnel. Success in the United States led to contracts with nuclear power plant operators in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

In 1988, Dr. Deutsch left General Physics to start RWD Technologies, a company focused on the IT revolution that was transforming the way companies manufactured products, managed their business operations and communicated with their suppliers and customers. Dr. D led RWD Technologies to become a world leader in performance improvement training and productivity products and services.

Throughout his career, Dr. Deutsch remained true to his commitment to invest in the education, training and development of people, and to promote innovative thinking and solutions for complex problems in the workplace.

### Robert and Florence

Robert Deutsch was born in New York City in 1924 to a family of modest means. He graduated from Far Rockaway High School in the top of his class.

In 1939, Robert enrolled at the City University of New York (CUNY) tuition-free due to his high academic standing. With the arrival of World War II, Bob left his studies to join the Army to fight for his country in Europe.

The Kadish family fled Poland in 1939 for New York City. Starting over as Jewish refugees from war-torn Europe was a great challenge, but they established themselves as small merchants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Florence and Robert first met in 1947 at Tamiment in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania where Robert was working for the summer as a waiter and Florence as a governess for a family vacationing near the resort. Robert had finished his junior year at M.I.T., where he enrolled after the Army in 1944 with the help of the G.I. Bill. Although they lived in separate cities they remained together after that summer.

After one year of graduate studies at M.I.T., Robert went back to New York where he and Florence were married in the summer of 1949. They moved to Berkeley where Florence was studying and Robert completed his doctoral degree.

Robert and Florence’s first child, Jane, was born in Berkeley. Three years later, their second child, David, was born. Completing his doctoral degree that year, Robert elected to pursue a career in the rapidly developing nuclear industry, joining the nuclear power division of General Electric in Schenectady, New York. After several corporate relocations, the family settled in Baltimore in 1964.
