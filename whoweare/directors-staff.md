Somehow print out bios here...

I know this is just a markdown file, but I can include any stuff in it to make that happen?

Currently all the bios are in their own subdirectory of the whoweare folder. However, they print out in the "whoweare.all" command. This needs to be resolved. Is there a way to first level only draw in content?
