<h1 id="toc_0">Creating new files via prose.io</h1>

<p>(This goes along with the video on vimeo here: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7192159/prosevideo_lg.mp4">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7192159/prosevideo_lg.mp4</a>)</p>

<p>Go to the folder you want, and then click the &quot;new file&quot; button up on top.</p>

<p>The browser should open a text editing window.</p>

<p>Change the title to the correct title, removing the date but keeping the prefix folder structure intact.</p>

<p>In the document section below, click in and delete the text that is there.</p>

<p>The document must start with at least this:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Title of Project&quot;
---
</code></pre>

<p>This is called the documents &quot;Meta Data&quot; and contains everything that isn&#39;t just the text of the post — link to images, what layout to use, which image to instead use on the featured blocks, etc.</p>

<p>here is an example of all the meta data options:</p>

<p>The categories you can pick from are as follows:
- &quot;science and tech&quot;
- &quot;arts and culture&quot;
- &quot;scholars and fellows&quot;
- &quot;social justice&quot;
- &quot;community&quot;</p>

<p>The layouts you can pick from are as follows: textonly, singleimage, or slideshow</p>

<p>Slideshow is the only layout that uses the &quot;image&quot; field. The rest will use the image from &quot;featureimg&quot; for the image that shows up on the homepage, as well as the image that shows up on the post in the case of &quot;singleimage&quot; (does this mean we don&#39;t need a &quot;textonly&quot; layout option???)</p>
