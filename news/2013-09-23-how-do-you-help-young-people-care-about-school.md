Sarah Hemminger is a neuroscientist by training. She was six months into her Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University when she and her husband founded theIncentive Mentoring Program, known to most simply as "IMP." IMP works by surrounding each student with what they call an "IMP Family": a group of up to eight volunteers, mostly grad students and undergraduates from nearby Johns Hopkins University, complete with a "Head of Household" and appointed "GrandParents".
