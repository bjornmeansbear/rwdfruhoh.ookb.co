Last spring, the Contemporary Museum in Baltimore shut down suddenly, mid-exhibition, without warning to its director, staff, or artists. The board cited financial issues in its announcement and said that although the museum would reopen at some point, it wanted “to take the necessary time and effort to plan for [the] future.” That was in May 2012. More than a year later, the Baltimore City Paper reported the Contemporary’s return. And last week, the museum’s new website went live, along with a welcome letter sent out from the institution’s new director, Deana Haggag.
