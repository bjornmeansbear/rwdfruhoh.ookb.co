Station North Arts and Entertainment, Inc., Amtrak, Parking Authority of Baltimore City, and The Mayor’s Office of Economic and Neighborhood Development all worked together to plan and implement a project that will create a “vibrant and comfortable” public space on Penn Station Plaza (the area immediately in front of Penn Station). There will be seating and tables, plants, shaded structures, as well as art oriented programs run and coordinated by Station North, MICA, and others will take place in the area.
