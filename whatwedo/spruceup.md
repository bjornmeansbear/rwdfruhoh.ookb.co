The first round of Spruce Up grants produced seven creative neighborhood improvement projects in the Station North Arts and Entertainment Disctrict in Baltimore. The goal of the Spurce Ups, coordinated by The Central Baltimore Partnership, was to deliver immediate and visible impact in the three neighborhoods that comprise Station North through high priority projects that could be completed within six months.
