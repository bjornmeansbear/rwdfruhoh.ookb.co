North Avenue is a major east-west thoroughfare and it is important to residents Station North and Baltimore as whole that the road is clean and presentable. [Charles North Community Association][CNCA], Midtown Community Benefits District, MICA, and Center City, Inc. all combined forces to design, develop and implement a project in which four large, solar powered, trash-compacting barrels line the sidewalks of North Ave. Local artists will have the opportunity to exhibit their work on the cans to “heighten the visual impact of the arts district.”
