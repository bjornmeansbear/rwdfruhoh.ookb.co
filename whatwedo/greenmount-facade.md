The Clean and Green Team of Greenmount West will encourage local residents to improve the dilapidated vacant city-owned properties along the main thoroughfares throughout the neighborhood calling on artists (with the guidance of [New Greenmount West Community Association][NGWCA]) to paint or stencil boarded up windows and doors.
