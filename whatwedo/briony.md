Playscape (East Baltimore) is a strategic initiative for improving access to play in underserved communities. These neighborhoods have a combination of high vacancy rates, negative social determinants of health, and relatively high percentage of residents who are children. Developing locally specific playscapes on the city-block level requires lowering barriers for communities. Using participatory, generative design processes, Playscape (East Baltimore) aims to develop tools that encourage play and empower neighbors to enrich and enjoy shared public spaces.
