Using an old Police booth at the corner of N. Charles and E. Lanvale, project leaders Deana Haggag (Contemporary Gallery Director and MICA Curatorial Practice MFA), Chloe Gallagher (MICA Curatorial Practice MFA), and Michael Benevento (Current Gallery and MICA alum) envisioned and have now implemented a rotating visual art display. The first installation, Blind Study II: A Psychology of Buildingby Adrian Lohmüller and Meghan Tomeo, opened on Sunday April 21st. On June 7th The Shaft presented a faux wedding ceremony at the Police booth – the disciplines range from poetry to paint. The Koban Project is yet another example of Station North’s thriving art community – a microcosm for Baltimore’s artistic vision.
