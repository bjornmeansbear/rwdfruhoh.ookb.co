Over the past decade, web technologies have become a "must have" for every type of business, government agency, community association and nonprofit organization.   Now an organization's website may include a blog, an RSS feed, a link to the organization's Facebook page, a place to view "tweets" submitted by staff or other contributors, and many other functional elements that make it a one-stop place for information, engagement and communications.

In 2001 as major businesses began investing in B2B web applications and online web shopping portals, only the most adventuresome and well-funded nonprofit organizations had the resources, technical expertise and strategic vision to have a web-site built for external communications.

Gayle Carney, however, recognized that web technologies would come to dominate all forms of communications and transform the world of nonprofit and civic life and work just as other IT systems and solutions had changed the world from analog to digital over the prior decade.  As the former chief information officer of a very large, national nonprofit and an early pioneer in bridging the digital divide for low-income communities, Gayle was determined to find ways to bring new digital communications strategies and systems to small and medium sized nonprofit organizations.

With support from the Deutsch Foundation, Ms. Carney launched the [Center for Community Technology Services][CCTS].  To create leverage for the start-up funding she received from the foundation, Ms. Carney partnered with the School of Information Arts and Technologies at the University of Baltimore so that she could tap into the talent pool of graduate students being attracted to this innovative program and benefit from the support systems available inside a university as an incubator for her innovative center.

In the early days, struggling nonprofits were often hesitant to invest scarce dollars into innovative web technologies.  To make the investment less risky, Ms. Carney secured additional dollars from the Deutsch Foundation to subsidize the cost of development of new web applications for her nonprofit clients.  Foundation funds also enabled her to recruit a core team of web developers so that she would have the capacity to expand her client base and off-set her early sales and marketing expenses while she built up her project volume.

Today the Center for Community Technology Services is a free-standing service provider, operating outside its university incubator and serving a wide-range of foundations, nonprofit organizations and civic groups in the Baltimore region.
