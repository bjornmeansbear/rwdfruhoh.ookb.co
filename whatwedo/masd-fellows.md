This new graduate program integrates art with design while stressing the importance of civic engagement. The program “prepares students to grow their skills, examine the designer’s role and responsibility in society, and bring about social change through design.” 

For the past two academic years, The Robert W. Deutsch Foundation has selected two graduates from the MASD program and awarded them a yearlong fellowship to implement their thesis project in the Baltimore Community. 

Last year’s fellows included Briony Hynson and Becky Slogeris. Hynson focusing on safe urban play in underserved communities designed and implemented an urban playscape in East Baltimore. She is still overseeing her original playscape on Bethel St. while helping create two new sites in Johnson Square and Greenmount West. She is also the Deputy Director of The Neighborhood Design Center as of June 2013. 

Slogeris’ thesis work focused on curriculum design in Baltimore classrooms and includes a BMore Fit Teacher Toolkit and a Baltimore Textbook, which explores the city’s many facets – physical, socio-economic, etc. Slogeris is the Graphic Administrator for the Baltimore Urban Debate League. 

The current Deutsch Fellows are Jonathan Erwin, who works improving urban heating and Mira Azarm, who works to improve Baltimore’s “food-desert” neighborhoods. More info on their progress will be posted on the blog.
