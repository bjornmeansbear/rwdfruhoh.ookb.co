“…it's just like a book library, but with tools!” That’s the tagline when you go to The Station North Tool Library’s website. The vision of John Shea and with the help of partner Piper Watson, the tool library has created an outlet for Baltimore area folks to borrow tools of all kinds from hammers to circular saws, for a small, affordable annual membership. That, coupled with the classes that will soon start, The Station North Tool Library is an innovative incubator for making, designing, and sustaining.

Find out more about the library on their [website](http://www.stationnorthtoollibrary.org) or head to our blog to read about the origins of John and Piper’s [innovative idea](http://rwdfblog.com/2013/06/25/keeping-it-local-and-doing-it-yourself-the-station-north-tool-library/).
