The Baltimore Arts Realty Corporation (BARCO) is a nonprofit organization providing affordable, efficient and sustainable facilities for artists, artisans, and arts organizations in Baltimore, Maryland. BARCO plans to lease space to Baltimore artists, artisans and arts organizations at annual rents significantly below comparable commercial rates.

BARCO recently purchased two properties – a building at 1400 Greenmount Ave and one 120 W. North Ave, both in the Station North Arts and Entertainment District. They will serve artists, makers, artisans and creators in the community. 

At this current time The Robert W. Deutsch Foundation is the sole funder of BARCO, but the corporation hopes to receive funding elsewhere in the future.
