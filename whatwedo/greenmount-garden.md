At the major intersection of North Avenue and Greenmount Avenue sits a recently transformed ornamental garden. Under the direction of Lowell Larson, Sandra Coles, and Linda Johnson of the Greater Greenmount Community Association and local artist, [Emily C-D][ECD], the space was created out of an open plot and featurs brightly colored Mexican-style macram√© woven into the fence. It adds some vibrancy to a highly trafficked intersection in Baltimore.
