Born out of the need for cultural unity within Baltimore, the GBCA was founded by Nancy Haragan in 2001. Since its launch, GBCA has served as both a catalyst and an incubator for various programs and initiatives in the region including The Baltimore Fun Guide, Weekly Fun Savers, Artist U, the Baker Artist Awards and The Rubys. 
 
GBCA's current Executive Director, Jeannie Howe, and her team has more than doubled the organization's membership over the past three years. The foundation has helped fund GBCA’s regular operating costs, a major website re-design, the Artist U program and the seed funding for The Rubys, which are individual project grants for Baltimore artists.
