 North Avenue is a major east-west thoroughfare and it is important to residents Station North and Baltimore as whole that the road is clean and presentable. [Charles North Community Association][CNCA], Midtown Community Benefits District, MICA, and Center City, Inc. all combined forces to design, develop and implement a project in which four large, solar powered, trash-compacting barrels will line the sidewalks of North Ave. Local artists will have the opportunity to exhibit their work on the cans to “heighten the visual impact of the arts district.”
