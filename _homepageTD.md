RWDF homepage.

This is my dream scenario for how these homepage front blocks work:

- There are 5 project blocks, 1 large one and 4 small ones.
- Client is shown a list of all their projects they have currently  on the site.
- client can then "promote" the 5 projects they want featured on the homepage.
- This then creates a "homepage projects" list; they need to be able to demote projects from this as wellâ€¦ 
- The blocks then fill as necessary. There can be a default order so that the large one knows how to get one of the projects, and the rest just fill the 4 remaining small blocks. 
- Then, it would be nice if there was a dynamic way to switch the order of the 5 promoted so that a site visitor might see a different project in the large section sometimes.

ALSO!

There are 3 more sections below the featured projects.
These three text areas need to also be easily editable.
I can make them .md files in their own collection, I just again need them to be easily spit out in that somewhat specialized layout.
