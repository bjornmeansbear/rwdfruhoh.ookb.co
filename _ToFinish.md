# RWDF to Finish.
_(for an example of what the site will look like (more or less) when all working visit [rwdf.ookb.co](http://rwdf.ookb.co/) — this document is referring to steps needed on this repo, [rwdfruhoh.ookb.co](http://rwdfruhoh.ookb.co/))_

## RWDF homepage.
This is my dream scenario for how these homepage front blocks work:

- There are 5 project blocks, 1 large one and 4 small ones.
- Client is shown a list of all their projects they have currently  on the site.
- client can then "promote" the 5 projects they want featured on the homepage.
- This then creates a "homepage projects" list; they need to be able to demote projects from this as well… 
- The blocks then fill as necessary. There can be a default order so that the large one knows how to get one of the projects, and the rest just fill the 4 remaining small blocks. 
- Then, it would be nice if there was a dynamic way to switch the order of the 5 promoted so that a site visitor might see a different project in the large section sometimes.


## Additional stuff:
- How to explain editing of MD files to client
- Multiple design templates for showing featured projects on homepage? (text only posts should be able to be featured somehow too?)

==========

## Big Stuff to Solve:
1. work on homepage project placement and then rotation
2. make just the folders from the repo that I want available to the clients for editing, not the whole repo...
3. work on integration with a flickr profile for images in slideshows, sidebars, etc.
4. make projects a CAPE powered promotable feed to the homepage
