RWDF Stuff to Finish.

## Big Stuff to Solve:
1. Get email form to work
2. Work on homepage project placement and then rotation - make projects a CAPE powered promotable feed to the homepage
3. Make just the folders from the repo that I want available to the clients for editing, not the whole repo... — I'd like to discuss coming up with a way for sharing just specific folders of a repo  – this way the client only sees folders they should be editing stuff within, not everything… I know you have been using prose.io for some of this
4. Need to work on integration with a flickr profile for images in slideshows, sidebars, etc.
