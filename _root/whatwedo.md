title: What We Do

# We love what we do.

We're proud of our work. From art to science, music to technology, education to social justice: whatever the project, we aim to make an impact.

The projects profiled here range across the areas of interest for the Deutsch Foundation: from the leading edge of biomedical engineering in a university, to a community-based agency that creates digital communications solutions for small nonprofits.

The Deutsch Foundation has a tradition of pro-active and engaged grant making, with its staff identifying creative individuals and innovative projects at early stages of development.

Prior to making any grant, the foundation's staff engages in extended discussions with the leaders of such projects or with the innovators proposing new approaches in one of the foundation's areas of interest.  We maintain active involvement with funded projects throughout the duration of our support.

Projects will be listed here eventually.
