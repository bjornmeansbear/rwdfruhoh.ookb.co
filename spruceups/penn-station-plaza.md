Station North Arts and Entertainment, Inc., Amtrak, the Parking Authority of Baltimore City, and The Mayor’s Office of Economic and Neighborhood Development all worked together to plan and implement a project that has created a “vibrant and comfortable” public space on Penn Station Plaza (the area immediately in front of Penn Station). There are now chairs and tables, plants, shaded structures, as well as art oriented programs coordinated by Station North, MICA, and others that energize and activate the area.
