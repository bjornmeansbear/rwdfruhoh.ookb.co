The Clean and Green Team of Greenmount West encouraged local residents to improve the dilapidated vacant city-owned properties along the main thoroughfares throughout the neighborhood and called on artists (with the guidance of [New Greenmount West Community Association][NGWCA]) to paint or stencil boarded up windows and doors on the Lanvale and Barclay block in the neighborhood.
