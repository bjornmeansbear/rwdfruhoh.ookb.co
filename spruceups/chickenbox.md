The vacant space at the southwest corner of Charles St. and North Avenue, formerly home to New York Fried Chicken, has been renovated into an office, gallery, and performing arts space to serve The [Station North Arts and Entertainment District][SNAED] office while also creating an interim use for part of the Parkway Theater redevelopment.
