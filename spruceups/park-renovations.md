The Charles North Community Association along with the Midtown Development Corp. have united with local residents to improve a small park between the 1700 and 1800 block of St. Paul St. The improvements include seating, lighting, litterbins, and a mural by local artist, Michael Owen, in conjunction with [Open Walls Baltimore][OWB].
