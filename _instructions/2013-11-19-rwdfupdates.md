# RWDF Design Updates

- What to do with the spruce ups page… Slideshow of the images — like on the other pages w/ slideshows and then figure out a way to make the bottom toggle on and off??? Think of it like the slideshow pages? just with a toggling ability to show/hide that main area

- add the image from this:
http://rwdfoundation.org/new_ideas__directions
on the http://rwdfruhoh.ookb.co/whoweare/

- Add the image blocks back on the who we are page.

- Fellows page will have 3 fellows initially.

- Projects pages -> way to make the side arrows loop continuously?

- Make the top nav more "link-y"?

- Twitter/Facebook up in the top somehow?

- Projects -> icons not on the right?
