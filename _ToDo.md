# RWDF Ruhoh/CAPE To dos.

## Homepage.
- Need to be able to promote projects from the projects page feed to the 5 homepage blocks.
- These 5 blocks are to then fill randomly on each page load — so that the big featured area “rotates” each time the page is loaded/refreshed — is that possible?

## Who We Are.
- Place the “Hero” text in the top from one .md file
- Each “Tab” is its own Markdown file (except bios)
- Bios were created as their own files in a sub-directory; how to make these print out as a list inside the last tab here?

## What We Do.
- Place the “Hero” text in the top from one .md file
- Projects are their own content type.
- Sorted by categories: but how to get categories to print out as classes on each of the list entries? Also, how to get categories to print out as the side-nav?
- These need to be promotable someway to the homepage.

## Tell Us About You.
- Place the “Hero” text in the top from one .md file
- This form could just be coded into a template file for this page?
- How to trigger the sending of the form?
- Make the sidebar its own .md file for easy edits/updates.

## Blog.
Not part of the ruhoh/CAPE site; powered and hosted externally by wordpress.

## Additional stuff:
- How to explain editing of MD files to client
- Anyway to just grant access to the content folders, not the whole git repo?
- Multiple ways to show featured projects on homepage? (text only posts should be able to be featured somehow too?)

- Navigation links…
if I don't want to put those “pages” in the root folder, so as to make them sensically organized with the rest of the site structure; can I do that… ? I guess what I'm saying is how do I tell ruhoh those pages exists as root level pages, but put their main content also in the sub-directories I created for the other bits of the sections?
(this is important for Who We Are, What We Do, and Tell Us About You pages)
