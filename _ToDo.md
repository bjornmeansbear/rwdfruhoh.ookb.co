# RWDF CAPE necessities

1. ## Homepage.
- Need to be able to promote projects from the projects page feed to the 5 homepage blocks.
- These 5 blocks are to then fill randomly on each page load — is that possible?

2. ## Who We Are.
- Place the “Hero” text in the top from one .md file
- Each “Tab” is its own Markdown file (except bios)
- Bios were created as their own files in a sub-directory; how to make these print out as a list here?

3. ## What We Do.
- Projects are their own content type.
- Sorted by categories: but how to get categories to print out as classes on each of the list entries? Also, how to get categories to print out as the side-nav?
- These need to be promotable someway to the homepage.

4. ## Tell Us About You.
- This form could just be coded into a template file for this page?
- How to trigger the sending of the form?
- Make the sidebar its own .md file for easy edits/updates.

5. ## Blog.
