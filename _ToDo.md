# RWDF Ruhoh/CAPE To dos.
_(for an example of what the site will look like (more or less) when all working visit [rwdf.ookb.co](http://rwdf.ookb.co/) — this document is referring to steps needed on this repo, [rwdfruhoh.ookb.co](http://rwdfruhoh.ookb.co/))_

## Homepage.
- Need to be able to promote projects from the projects page (what we do page) feed to the 5 homepage blocks.
- These 5 blocks are to then fill randomly on each page load — so that the big featured area “rotates” each time the page is loaded/refreshed — is that possible? (there is a 6th block, which will have just text in it that I don't think needs to change)

## Who We Are.

## What We Do.

## Tell Us About You.
- How to trigger the sending of the form? Does it need to be a wufoo form? is there some JS or other server solution that can trigger an email to be sent?

## Additional stuff:
- How to explain editing of MD files to client
- Multiple design templates for showing featured projects on homepage? (text only posts should be able to be featured somehow too?)

==========

## Big Stuff to Solve:
1. get email form to work
2. work on homepage project placement and then rotation
3. make just the folders from the repo that I want available to the clients for editing, not the whole repo...
4. work on integration with a flickr profile for images in slideshows, sidebars, etc.
5. make projects a CAPE powered promotable feed to the homepage
